While there are numerous image repositoroes that are in common use (NITRC-IR, [mant individual] XNAT, LORIS, 
COINS, LONI IDA, etc.) the community would be greatly benefitted by an image search function that can span across 
these multiple image data sources.

In this project we take a small subset of this problem, namely generating a query that will span multiple XNAT instances 
(i.e. NITRC-IR and XNAT Central) and generate a unified result. Upon successful implementation of this typs of function, 
additional XNAT instances should be able to be added to this inter-XNAT search, and then finally, the framework should be 
extended to incorporate the non-XNAT data sources.
